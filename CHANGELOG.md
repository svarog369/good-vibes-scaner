## [1.0.0] - 2024-08-14 🎉

### ✨ Added
- 🔍 **Smart Secret Detection** - Detects API keys, AWS credentials, private keys, JWT tokens, and high-entropy secrets
- 🧠 **False Positive Filtering** - Intelligently ignores CamelCase identifiers and common code patterns  
- 📁 **Dual Scanning Mode** - Scan current working directory and/or git commit history
- 🎯 **Entropy Analysis** - Uses mathematical entropy to identify real secrets vs random strings
- 🧪 **Test-Aware Scanning** - More lenient filtering for test files to reduce noise
- 🚀 **Performance Optimized** - Built with Haskell for speed and memory efficiency
- 💫 **Good Vibes Interface** - Friendly, emoji-rich output that doesn't harsh your mellow
- 🔧 **Flexible Configuration** - Command-line options for different scanning modes
- 📊 **Pattern Matching** - Comprehensive regex patterns for various secret types
- 🛡️ **Security Best Practices** - Built with security-first mindset

### 🔍 Secret Detection Capabilities
- **API Keys**: Stripe (`sk_`, `pk_`), generic `API_KEY` patterns
- **AWS Access Keys**: `AKIA...`, `ASIA...` patterns
- **Private Keys**: RSA, EC, generic private key detection
- **Database URLs**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis with credentials
- **JWT Tokens**: Complete JWT structure validation
- **High Entropy Strings**: Mathematical analysis for random-looking secrets

### 🎨 Features That Bring Good Vibes
- **CamelCase Detection**: Won't flag legitimate code identifiers
- **Code Pattern Recognition**: Ignores common variable naming patterns
- **Binary File Filtering**: Skips non-text files automatically
- **Git Integration**: Seamlessly works with any git repository
- **Commit History Analysis**: Deep dive into repository history
- **Current File Scanning**: Quick pre-commit security checks
- **Configurable Depth**: Choose how many commits to analyze

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- Written in Haskell for type safety and performance
- Comprehensive test suite with HSpec and QuickCheck
- Property-based testing for robust validation
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Clean separation of concerns across modules

### 📚 Documentation & Community
